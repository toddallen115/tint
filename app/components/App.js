import React from 'react';
// import {Link, Route} from 'react-router-dom';
// this will contain and render the very outer containers of each page of the website.
// what is the best way to render things on a change of url, like when you want a completely different route and page?

const App = () =>
    <div>
        This is working!
    </div>;

export default App;
